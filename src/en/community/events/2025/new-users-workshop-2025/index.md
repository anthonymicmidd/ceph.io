### Welcome to the Ceph New Users Workshop!

Welcome to the Ceph New Users Workshop!
New to Ceph? Join us for a hands-on workshop designed specifically for beginners, held the afternoon before Cephalocon 2025 kicks off in Vancouver.

This session will guide you through the fundamentals of Ceph, its architecture, use cases, and how to get started with your cluster. By the end of the day, you will have a running Ceph deployment and a solid understanding of how to operate and scale it. No prior experience required, just bring your laptop and your questions!

Attendees are required to bring their laptop to participate in this workshop.
